# Production Scripts

:warn: Dangerous Content! :warn:

As you might imagine, this directory contains scripts for working with resources in the production environment. You'll need to create a `.env` file for this directory (by copying the environment variables from Railway). Make backups and use discretion. **Better safe than sorry!** An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, and a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.
